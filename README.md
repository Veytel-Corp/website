# website2024

## Getting Started
As of now, the website is only client-side so there is really no setup.

The easiest way to get the ball rolling for development (if using VSCode) is to install the extension "Live Server" by Ritwick Dey. Right-click on the html file you want to open and then select "Start Live Server".

## File Navigation
The file structure is fairly straightforward; all visual assets are in the assets folder, CSS and JS files are in their respective folders. Right now, the main html pages are located in the root folder of the project, and the html file holds reusable html assets like the content of the header tag for each page.
